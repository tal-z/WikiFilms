# WikiFilms! 


## What is it?
A streaming animation of all the edits to a given Wikipedia page. 

## How it works.
It works by creating a "virtual camera," which is actually a headless web browser, and then piping screenshot data from the headless browser to a template via a flask application. See the sister project, [WikiFlix](https://github.com/tal-z/WikiFlix), which runs in a Matplotlib application. 

## Why is it?
I thought it would be cool to see how certain Wikipedia pages grow and change over time. I don't have a better reason...sorry.


Enjoy!
