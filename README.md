# WikiFilms! 


### What is it?
A streaming animation of all the edits to a given Wikipedia page.



### Why is it?
I thought it would be cool to see. I don't have a better reason...sorry.

### Where is it
You can find a mostly-broken version deployed at [wikifilms.herokuapp.com](wikifilms.herokuapp.com)


### This was a good project. Here's why:

##### I played with fun data:
  - The [MediaWiki action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) is amazing 

##### I explored different language features of Python:
  - generators for streaming data (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/patterns/streaming/)
  - async/await (did not use in the end)

##### I had good pair programming experiences:
  - Sped up development of new features
  - Got good feedback about my programming practices
  - I met nice people at the Recurse Center :)

##### I encountered new technologies:
  - Touched jquery for the first time
  - Played with cv2 and facial recognition by accident

##### I'm left with things to work on:
  - Building a loading screen
  - Introducing a task queue with Redis and possibly Celery 
  - Adding an ending frame 
  - Making jquery autocomplete suggestions more responsive 
  - Alternatively, taking away the search bar, and making it play a random article
    - This could work if I added a "channel change" feature 
  - Using responses from the MediaWiki API more effectively 
  - Exploring methods for composing an image from a headless web browser 
    - should I render the HTML myself instead of saving to image?
